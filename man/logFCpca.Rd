\usage{
logFCpca(edgeResult)
}
\arguments{
\item{edgeResult}{An \code{EdgeResult} object}
}
\value{
A \code{PCAScoreMatrix} object

The function performs principal component analysis (PCA) to the log 
fold-change matrix. 

By using a column of zeros during the PCA analysis,
which was removed from the final result, the point of origin represents 
an ideal contrast which yield absolutely no differential gene expression. 
It is easier to interpret the PCA results with this transformation.
